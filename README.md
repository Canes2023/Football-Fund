# Football-Fund

For this project, I was tasked with making anything I wanted as long as it met the requirements needed. I gave my idea to the professors and they said it was fine. I created a football fundraiser for a local high school which allows anybody to view the website and donate a specific amount from the custom donation area or donate a pre selected amount like $50, $100, $200, etc. The website is vibrant and easy to read. The user can easily find where to donate and click the "donate" button when they're finished selecting their desired amount. As of writing this now, the current total amount is not showing how much is donated and sometimes it will only show what the last donated amount was and it won't add up the donations. It just changes to the next donated amount. For example, someone could donated $200 and it will say $200 is the current total amount but when the next person donates $300, instead of saying $500, it will just say $300. If someone donates $900, then it'll just say $900 instead of adding up the donations. I've been working on this project for a while now and I'm close to finishing it. I just need to fix this issue and it's done (For now. I still want to add more things to it). Unfortunately, I just couldn't fix it and I have to move on to the next module assignment so I don't fall behind.
