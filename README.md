# Football-Fund

For this project, I was tasked with making anything I wanted as long as it met the requirements needed. I gave my idea to the professors and they said it was fine. I created a football fundraiser for a local high school which allows anybody to view the website and donate a specific amount from the custom donation area or donate a pre selected amount like $50, $100, $200, etc. The website is vibrant and easy to read. The user can easily find where to donate and click the "donate" button when they're finished selecting their desired amount. The current total amount correctly displays the current total donation amount where as before, it wasn't able to do so. The user can finally donated a pre amount or a custom amount and it will correctly display it. The user can continue donating even after the donation goal has been met. It feels so satisfying to finally get something to work afetr weeks and weeks of debugging. 

The application may have some donations already. That was me testing to see if the current total was working.
